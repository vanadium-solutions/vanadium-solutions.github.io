    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <div class="about-text">
      <h3>Our Vision & Philosophy</h3>
      <p>We exist to restore <strong>digital sovereignty</strong> in a world dominated by cloud platforms and commoditized AI. Vanadium builds systems that are truly yours: installed on your hardware, trained on your documents, governed by your policies, and constrained by your rules. We see the future of AI not as something you subscribe to, but as something you <strong>own and control</strong>.</p>
      <h3>Why Vanadium</h3>
      <p>Vanadium is different because we do not compromise. Our systems are <strong>air-gapped by default</strong> and operate without any third-party dependencies. We deliver infrastructure that is <strong>bespoke by design</strong>, adapting to your workflows, language, and security posture. Every deployment is engineered with <strong>operational fit</strong> in mind and supported with <strong>discretion and discipline</strong>.</p>
      <h3>Leadership & Partners</h3>
      <p>Behind Vanadium is a discreet team of engineers, applied AI specialists, and security architects with backgrounds in regulated industries, critical infrastructure, and enterprise technology. We work only with selected partners in hardware and security to ensure our systems remain hardened, auditable, and sovereign from end to end.</p>
